During my Bachelor's thesis I investigated if reinforcment learning is better than supervised learning in task completion 
dialogues. You can find the code for the RL part [here](https://github.com/Davide-Guidolin/Reinforcement-learning-SGD) and my
thesis [here](https://github.com/Davide-Guidolin/Reinforcement-learning-SGD/blob/master/Guidolin_Davide_Informatica_2020_2021.pdf).
