## Academic Bio

Hi, I'm Davide Guidolin, a student in the **Artificial Intelligence Systems** master degree at the University of Trento. I'm currently attending the 2<sup>nd</sup> year and specialising in the **Computer Vision** path.

I obtained my bachelor's degree in **Computer Science** in 2021 (110 Cum Laude) with the thesis _"Supervised learning vs Reinforcement learning in task completion dialogues"_.

## Work experience

* **April 2023 - September 2023** I did an internship at [PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/) in Paris, where I mainly worked on improving the appearance of the images using AI. I also worked on the optimization of AI models.

* **August 2021 - October 2021**  I did an internship at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) where I had to implement
the support for gamepads for the [NICE DCV](https://aws.amazon.com/it/hpc/dcv/) remote display protocol.

* **March 2021 - May 2021** I did a remote internship at [VUI Inc.](https://www.vui.com/) where I developed a user simulator needed for the training of a dialogue system. After the internship I used the user simulator for my bachelor's thesis.

## Sport

I've been a professional swimmer until 2020. I obtained many national medals between 2013 and 2017 and in 2015 I won the Italian Youth Championship in the 100m freestyle and I partecipated at the European Youth Olympic Festival with the Italian national team.

## Hobbies

I really like hiking on the Dolomites and in 2022 me and my girlfriend completed the ["Via Degli Dei"](https://www.viadeglidei.it/) walk that goes from Bologna to Florence (~130 km in 6 days).
