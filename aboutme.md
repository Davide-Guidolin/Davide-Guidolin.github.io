## Academic Bio

Hi, I'm Davide Guidolin. I hold a Master's degree in **Artificial Intelligence Systems** and a Bachelor's degree in **Computer Science**, both from the University of Trento. I'm an IT and AI enthusiast with a keen interest in economics and finance.

I'm an ambitious person who thrives on challenges, a trait I developed during my time as a professional swimmer. This experience taught me the value of hard work and perseverance, culminating in winning an Italian youth championship. I believe in maintaining a positive outlook and always looking for the good in every situation.

## Work experience

*   **July 2024 - Now**: I am an **AI Researcher** at GPI, where I specialize in building, integrating, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art AI models. My work focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to create innovative solutions for the healthcare sector.

*   **May 2024 - July 2024**: I worked as a **Software & Data Engineer** at SATE S.r.l. in Venice, Italy.

*   **April 2023 - September 2023**: I was an intern at [PhotoRoom](https://www.photoroom.com/) in Paris. I worked with the ML team to explore, implement, and optimize new deep learning solutions for a new feature in the PhotoRoom application. I also gained experience in ML development for production and model optimization using ONNX and TensorRT.

*   **August 2021 - October 2021**: I interned at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) where I was part of the NICE DCV team. My main project was to implement gamepad support for the NICE DCV desktop remotization protocol. This experience allowed me to learn more about C, Rust, teamwork, and managing large-scale projects.

*   **March 2021 - May 2021**: I had a remote internship at [VUI Inc.](https://www.vui.com/) I was part of the R&D team and developed a user simulator for training a dialogue system. I later used this simulator for my bachelor's thesis, where I trained a reinforcement learning agent.

## Sport

I've been a professional swimmer until 2020. I obtained many national medals between 2013 and 2017 and in 2015 I won the Italian Youth Championship in the 100m freestyle and I partecipated at the European Youth Olympic Festival with the Italian national team.

## Hobbies

I really like hiking on the Dolomites and in 2022 me and my girlfriend completed the ["Via Degli Dei"](https://www.viadeglidei.it/) walk that goes from Bologna to Florence (~130 km in 6 days).
